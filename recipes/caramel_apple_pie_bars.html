        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li><br>
        <li>1 large egg</li><br>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li><br>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li><br>
    </ul>

    <h3>Apple Filling:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li><br>
        <li>5 Granny Smith apples, peeled and diced</li><br>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar</li><br>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li><br>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li><br>
        <li>¼ teaspoon grated nutmeg</li><br>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li><br>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch, or as needed</li><br>
    </ul>

    <h1>Directions</h1>

    <h5>Step 1</h5>
    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.

    </p>

    <h5>Step 2</h5>
    <p>Combine flour, 1 cup butter, 3/4 cup white sugar, egg, baking powder, <br>
       and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor; pulse until crumbled and easily formed into dough when pinched. <br>
       Pour 3/4 of the dough into the prepared pan; press down with your hands until crust is even and well-packed.

    </p>

    <h5>Step 3</h5>
    <p>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. <br> 
       Add apples, brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt; cook and stir until apples are <br>
       softened, about 5 minutes. <br>
       Stir in cornstarch; mix, adding more cornstarch if needed, until liquid has thickened.

    </p>

    <h5>Step 4</h5>
    <p>Pour caramel-apple mixture onto crust; smooth with a spatula until even. Crumble remaining dough on top.</p>

    <h5>Step 5</h5>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. <br>
       Let cool for 10 minutes; cut into bars.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>If you don't have a food processor, you could use a hand beater to combine the crust ingredients.
       Drizzle with a homemade salted caramel sauce or a store-bought caramel sauce.

        <li>½ teaspoon dried parsley</li><br>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic granules</li><br>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>

    <h5>Step 1</h5>
    <p>Combine flour, yogurt, garlic granules, Italian seasoning, and salt in a bowl; mix to combine.
    </p>

    <h5>Step 2</h5>
    <p>Dust work surface with more flour. Transfer dough to work surface. Knead dough for 8 to 10 minutes with the palm of your hand. <br>

    <h5>Step 3</h5>

    <p>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). <br>
       Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat (such as Silpat®).
    </p>

    <h5>Step 4</h5>

    <p>Shape dough into a rounded loaf. Using a bench scraper, cut off 8 wedges of dough. <br>
       Roll each wedge of dough into a rope shape and tie into knots. <br>
       Place knots onto the prepared baking sheet.
    </p>

    <h5>Step5</h5>

    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until knots are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.
    </p>

    <h5>Step 6</h5>

    <p>Meanwhile, combine melted butter, oil, garlic granules, and parsley for topping in a small glass bowl. <br>
       Brush mixture over the warm knots.
